# Contextual Multimethods

This is basically a repository to experiment with the concept of contextual multimethods,
mostly because implementing it in Siren right now would require reimplementing the entire
compiler with new semantics and syntax (which are hardly final yet) and that's a pain :)

The concept is based on stuff you can see in Korz (contexts), CLOS (multimethods),
and Clojure (ad-hoc hierarchies).
